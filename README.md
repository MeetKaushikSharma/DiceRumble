# 🎲 DiceRumble

A simple 2-player dice game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. On each refresh, both players roll a die, and the game announces the winner — or a draw. Just a fun little project to practice DOM manipulation and a bit of styling.

## ⚙️ How It Works

- When the page loads, two random numbers between 1–6 are generated.
- Each dice image updates based on the number rolled.
- The game shows who won or if it’s a draw.

No buttons — just refresh the page to play again.

## 🧠 What I Used

- **HTML** – for the structure  
- **CSS** – for basic styling and layout  
- **JavaScript** – to add the game logic and interactivity

---

## 🚀 Future Ideas

- Add a "Roll" button (instead of using refresh)
- Keep track of scores across multiple rounds
- Add some animations or sound effects for better experience
